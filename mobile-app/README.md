# Gaza Boycott Helper Mobile App

## Overview
This mobile app allows users to scan product images to identify companies that support violence in Gaza and provides alternatives to their products.

## Current Implementation
The current implementation includes:
- A camera interface with a scanner frame
- A button to select images from the gallery
- A capture button that works with long press

## Next Steps
- Integrate actual camera functionality using expo-camera
- Implement image recognition to identify products
- Connect to a database of boycott-worthy companies
- Provide alternatives to boycotted products

## Running the App
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Notes
- The camera functionality is currently mocked for development purposes
- The actual camera integration will be implemented in a future update
