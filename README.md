# Gaza Boycott Helper

## Overview
Gaza Boycott Helper is a web application designed to help consumers make informed decisions about the products they purchase. The application allows users to identify companies that support violence in Gaza and provides alternatives to their products. By scanning product images or searching for company names, users can quickly determine if a product is from a company that should be boycotted.

## Purpose
This project aims to:
- Raise awareness about companies that directly or indirectly support violence in Gaza
- Empower consumers to make ethical purchasing decisions
- Provide a simple, accessible tool for identifying boycott-worthy products
- Offer alternatives to products from companies that support violence

## Features
- **Image Recognition**: Upload product images to identify companies
- **Real-time Analysis**: Get immediate feedback on scanned products
- **Company Database**: Comprehensive list of companies supporting violence in Gaza
- **Product Alternatives**: Suggestions for ethical alternatives to boycotted products
- **Educational Resources**: Information about why specific companies are listed

## How It Works
1. Upload an image of a product through the web interface
2. The application analyzes the image using AI to identify the product and company
3. If the company is in our boycott database, you'll receive information about why they're listed
4. The application may suggest alternative products from ethical companies

## Technical Implementation
- Django web framework
- WebSocket for real-time communication
